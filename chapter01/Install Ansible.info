# we are required to install Ansible on the host.. 

Centos/RedHat: 
```
sudo yum install -y ansible
```

Ubuntu:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ansible -y
```

Once after installing, you have an invetory file in this repo and you are required to query to check, 
if that lists you all the hosts from Ansible

```
ansible all -m ping
ansible web -m ping
ansible db -m ping
```
